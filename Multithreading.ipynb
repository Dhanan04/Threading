    "Improved performance: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of tasks, which can lead to better CPU utilization and faster execution times.\n",

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity into the program, making it harder to reason about and debug.\n",

    "Synchronization issues: Concurrent access to shared resources can lead to synchronization problems like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Creating and managing threads has its own overhead, and excessive threading can lead to decreased performance due to context switching."

    "Deadlock: Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources they need to proceed. In a deadlock situation, none of the threads can make progress. Deadlocks are typically caused by improper synchronization of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions: Race conditions occur when the behavior of a program depends on the timing or interleaving of multiple threads. It arises when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the order of execution. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect results. Proper synchronization techniques like locks and mutexes are used to prevent race conditions"
